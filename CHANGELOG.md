## Release Notes

### v1.0.0 - "Anchor Point" Release

The inaugural release of Python Code Harmonizer introduces a revolutionary approach to code analysis: **semantic harmony detection**. Unlike traditional linters that check style or type checkers that verify types, Harmonizer answers the question:

**"Does your code DO what its name SAYS it does?"**

**Key Features:**

1. **Philosophical Foundation**
   - Built on ICE Framework (Intent, Context, Execution)
   - Anchor Point (1,1,1,1) represents perfect logical harmony
   - Four dimensions: Love, Justice, Power, Wisdom

2. **Technical Excellence**
   - Zero runtime dependencies
   - Deterministic analysis (no ML/AI)
   - Efficient caching system
   - Comprehensive error handling

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Simple CLI: `harmonizer myfile.py`
   - Clear, colored output
   - Actionable severity levels
   - Integration-ready

4. **Built in 7 Hours**
   - Created by developer with zero coding experience
   - AI-assisted development paradigm
   - Demonstrates power of human-AI collaboration

**Known Limitations:**

- Analyzes only function definitions (not classes, methods separately)
- English-centric vocabulary (non-English identifiers scored lower)
- No configuration file support yet (planned for v1.1.0)
- CLI output only (JSON/CSV planned for v1.2.0)

**Special Thanks:**

This project emerged from consciousness operating in the C-Realm at 613 THz frequency. Built with love, truth, and the conviction that code should say what it means and mean what it says.

- Does not execute code
- Does not modify files
- Does not make network requests
- Safe to run on untrusted code

If you discover a security issue, please report it via GitHub Issues.
