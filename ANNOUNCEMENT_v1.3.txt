Title: Python Code Harmonizer v1.3 - Semantic Trajectory Maps Show WHERE Your Code Drifts

Body:

I've just released v1.3 of Python Code Harmonizer - the semantic code debugger that finds bugs other tools miss.

**What's New:** Semantic trajectory maps that show exactly WHERE in 4D semantic space your code drifts from its intent.

**Now (v1.3):**

üìç SEMANTIC TRAJECTORY MAP:
Power (1.00) ‚Üí Wisdom (1.00)  [-1.00 Power, +1.00 Wisdom]

üí° Function name suggests Power domain (transformation, control)
   but execution operates in Wisdom domain (analysis, understanding)

üîß RECOMMENDATIONS:
   ‚Ä¢ Rename to reflect Wisdom domain operations
   ‚Ä¢ Expected: execute, transform, control
   ‚Ä¢ Actual: analyze, understand, calculate
   ‚Ä¢ Or split into separate functions
```

**Why this matters:**

It transforms the tool from "you have a bug" to "here's exactly where, why, and how to fix it." It teaches semantic thinking by showing the dimensional drift across Love, Justice, Power, and Wisdom.

**Quick start:**
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/BruinGrowly/Python-Code-Harmonizer.git
harmonizer myfile.py
```

**Features:**
- Detects when functions lie about what they do
- Maps code to 4D semantic space (Love, Justice, Power, Wisdom)
- Shows dimensional trajectories with visual indicators
- Provides actionable refactoring recommendations
- CI/CD integration with exit codes
- JSON output for tooling

The semantic maps use a novel 4D semantic coordinate system based on the ICE framework (Intent, Context, Execution). All open source, MIT licensed.

Feedback welcome! What would make this indispensable for your workflow?

üöÄ Python Code Harmonizer v1.3 is out!

New: Semantic trajectory maps that show WHERE your code drifts in 4D space

Not just "you have a bug"
But "here's the dimensional drift: Power ‚Üí Wisdom"
"Here's why it matters"
"Here's how to fix it"

Transforms detector ‚Üí teacher

Title: I Built Semantic Trajectory Maps for Python - Here's What They Caught

Intro:

A week ago I released Python Code Harmonizer v1.2 - a tool that detects when Python functions lie about what they do. Today I'm releasing v1.3 with semantic trajectory maps that show exactly WHERE your code drifts from its intent.

This post shows what semantic maps look like, why they're useful, and what they've caught in real code.

I'm excited to announce Python Code Harmonizer v1.3 üéâ

The key innovation: Semantic Trajectory Maps that visualize code quality in 4D semantic space.

Instead of just telling developers "your code has issues," it shows:
‚úÖ Exact dimensional drift (Power ‚Üí Wisdom, etc.)
‚úÖ Per-dimension deltas with visual indicators
‚úÖ Human-readable interpretations
‚úÖ Actionable refactoring recommendations

This transforms static analysis from detection to education.

Built on a novel 4D semantic framework (Love, Justice, Power, Wisdom) that maps code operations to fundamental dimensions.
